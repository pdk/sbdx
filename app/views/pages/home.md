### Stolen Bicycle Data Exchange

The purpose of this site is to provide an open platform for bicycle registries
to share data about bicycles that are stolen or missing.

The aim is to make it trivial for any person to find out if a 
particular bicycle is stolen or missing. By allowing different
bicycle registry services to exchange information about stolen bicycles,
a person will not need to visit every bicycle registry individually
and search, but should be able to search via any single registry
that participates in the data exchange.
